# Weather lab

Simple clock/weather app playing around with vue 3 and vite.

This is a lab experiment, hopefully useful to beginner developers.

## Features

You may learn some of the following :)

-   Using vue 3 and vite
-   Storing data in both localStorage and vuex
-   Creating a self-correcting interval for our clock
-   Fetching weather from an API
-   Storing an API key as an environment variable
-   Dark/light mode via css variables for zero-flicker
-   Using utility based classes via Tailwind CSS
-   Formatting and linting your code with eslint/prettier

## Getting started

Visit [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) to generate an API key.

Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`, using your API key.
